# python
#### this is a repository of all my modified source codes written in Python.

----
## NOTE:
The source codes uploaded here are **MODIFIED** - meaning, if you just randomly copied and ran the program, it **will NOT RUN**.
To make the program work, you have to skim through the code aka you fix it ;)

Once you do fix it, however, consider the code yours.

These codes are under the IDGAF Licence. **tl;dr**, do whatever you want at your own leisure. Full license is in this repository under
*IDGAF_License.txt*. Fair warning that I do not own the text file nor written it.

Also, these codes are written in **Python**.

----
### Notice:
This repository is made to help aspiring programmers and guide them to make their programs work. I am no professional programmer nor instructor, I am just a person who likes to help anyone I can.

### How to download?

Click the **clone or download** green button on the top of the repository. It downloads a .zip file.

Same with Linux users and Windows users. Pick your poison.
