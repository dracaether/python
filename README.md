### FAQ:

**-NEW-** Q. What's the [random stuff folder](https://github.com/dracaether/python/tree/master/random%20stuff) for? 

A. I'm cleaning up both my main workstation to prepare for reinstalling Windows 10 for my recreational stuff like gaming, video editing and such. Those are my hobbies aside from coding stuff.
These codes were written during the span of 1 college semester learning Python, but never see the light (until now) due to 
me focusing on other programs to finish. So, they have their own folder.

----
Q. Your code is wrong/That is not how you do it!

A. Well excuuuuuuuuse me princess! If I could remember, there are a lot of ways to make a program. If it bothers you this much, then I don't know why you're still here. If you have actual concerns, however, **kindly** [issue](https://github.com/dracaether/python/issues/new) or pm me via [facebook](https://www.facebook.com/dracaether).

----
  Q.  I see an error on your code!

  A. [Issue](https://github.com/dracaether/python/issues/new) an error (if you have an account), or pm me via [facebook](https://www.facebook.com/dracaether).
  
----
  Q. I want to contribute/help!
  
  A. You can do that by [pulling a request](https://github.com/dracaether/python/compare) or fork (by clicking 'fork' on the top right of the page) this repo into your account and modify what needs to be modified. While you can contribute/help via FB, it's easier to manage if you have a GitHub account. Click [here](https://github.com) to start making one.
 
----
  Q. How long does it take you to upload?
  
  A. Since these are just codes, it takes no time at all! However, I am human and sometimes I have life to tend to, so any updates to old codes, corrections, additions and especially taking down codes may sometimes get delayed.

----
  Q. Can I share this link to anyone?
  
  A. Hey, as long as you believe that this repo can help them, why not?
  
----
  Q. How did you come up with this?
  
  A. The repo? People nowadays are asking me how to write a program and while I love to help, going around group chats and pms tends to be tedious for me, and sometimes when I'm out and about I don't always bring my laptop/phone/flashdrive with me. This exists to help them, even when I'm not around.
  
----
  Q. No, really, how did you come up with this [insert code here]?
  
  A. Have questions about the code? Pm me!


**If you have any more questions, better issue or pm me.**
