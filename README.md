----
  Q. How long does it take you to upload?
  
  A. Since these are just codes, it takes no time at all! However, I am human and sometimes I have life to tend to, so any updates to old codes, corrections, additions and especially taking down codes may sometimes get delayed.

----
  Q. Can I share this link to anyone?
  
  A. Hey, as long as you believe that this repo can help them, why not?
  
----
  Q. How did you come up with this?
  
  A. The repo? People nowadays are asking me how to write a program and while I love to help, going around group chats and pms tends to be tedious for me, and sometimes when I'm out and about I don't always bring my laptop/phone/flashdrive with me. This exists to help them, even when I'm not around.
  
----
  Q. No, really, how did you come up with this [insert code here]?
  
  A. Have questions about the code? Pm me!


**If you have any more questions, better issue or pm me.**
