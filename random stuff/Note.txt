Hello, world!

This folder is filled with random codes I have come up with thanks to my boredom (and probably fascination - how to distinguish?).

Reason for uploading: After the semester ends, I will be reinstalling Arch Linux to both of my laptops.
The main workstation (a battletop setup (laptop + external monitor)) and the back burner laptop.

And also: for my pending MacBook (yet to arrive) to retrieve these files. I'm having a Mac in my arsenal now.

As programmers, we have to be versatile in computers and OSes, right?

Thanks for reading I guess? Oh, and beware of the 'randomcomb.py' file.

...it slows down computers if you lack the ram. :]

Have fun!
